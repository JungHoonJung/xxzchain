# Welcome to xxzchain package wiki!

## XXZChain
 This module provides exact diagonalization of Hamiltonian of the xxz-spin chain system(i.e. Hubbard model, lattice fermion, hardcore boson).  
 If you set each site of lattice for identifying, then each site has only two states (1 or 0, up or down, etc.). So that we can rewrite an arbitrary state of spin-basis as binary. With this idea, the System has 2^L Hilbert space dimensionality. With interest in some specific regime, the Hilbert space dimensionality will decrease.
